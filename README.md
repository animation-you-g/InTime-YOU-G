# InTime By YOU-G
InTime is a free, tool that tracks your work and displays it interactively, helping you monitor your productivity effortlessly.

Important Note
The app uses a work data JSON file to save all your work. This file is the core of the app, so losing it means losing your saved data.

⚠️ Make sure to back up this file regularly, especially if you plan to reinstall your OS or move to a new device.
